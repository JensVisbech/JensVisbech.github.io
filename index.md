Welcome to my personal webpage. Here you will find highlights and information about my research.


# About me - Jens Visbech
I'm a 28-year-old originally from the countryside of Jutland, Denmark. However, I've been living in Copenhagen for the past seven years. I have a deep appreciation for travel and enjoy spending my spare time cycling around the outskirts of Copenhagen and whereever I go traveling.

### Research at the moment:
I'm currently doing my Ph.D. at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). My project, "New Advanced Simulation Techniques for Wave Energy Converters," is funded by a DTU Ph.D. scholarship at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science (Compute) and will continue until January 31, 2026.
